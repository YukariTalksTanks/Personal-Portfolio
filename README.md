My reasoning for making this program/website was in order to not only gain experience but help get my name out into the business world as well as giving potential employers an easy was of getting to know me before and/or after an interview.

This is my personal portfolio that I can update at any time. This benifits me like an electronic resume and shows my skill level at work.
some of the following was used to make the program:
-used bootstrap and its javascript to create a usable navbar
-seperate hmtl files were mad and linked to the navbar for navigation of information
-image links and thier corresponding alts were used to personalize the page
-a css style file was created to format the pages properly
-tab titles were created
-grid elements were inplimented for formatting with different screen sizes

I personally enjoyed this homework and was able to figure out most if not all hiccups along the way.
